# Cross-compiling for Android is handled by the NDK's own provided toolchain,
# which as of this writing, should be in
# ${ndk_root}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake
#
# Certain older NDK versions may also need to explicitly pick the libc++
# runtime. So for example:
# cmake .. -DANDROID_STL=c++_shared \
#     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${ndk_root}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake
#
# Certain NDK versions may also need to use the lld linker to avoid errors
# about missing liblog.so and libOpenSLES.so. That can be done by:
# cmake .. -DANDROID_LD=lld \
#     -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${ndk_root}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake
#
